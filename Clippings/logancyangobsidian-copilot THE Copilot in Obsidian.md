## 🙋♂️ FAQ

**Why isn’t Vault search finding my notes?**

If you're using the Vault QA mode (or the tool `@vault` in Plus), try the following:

- Ensure you have a working embedding model from your AI model's provider (e.g. OpenAI). Watch this video: [AI Model Setup (API Key)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzMbiamzOqM)
- Ensure your Copilot indexing is up-to-date. Watch this video: [Vault Mode](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBLMWE8WRFU)
- If issues persist, run **Force Re-Index** or use **List Indexed Files** from the Command Palette to inspect what's included in the index.
- ⚠️ **Don’t switch embedding models after indexing** —it can break the results.
**Why is my AI model returning error code 429: ‘Insufficient Quota’?**

Most likely this is happening because you haven’t configured billing with your chosen model provider—or you’ve hit your monthly quota. For example, OpenAI typically caps individual accounts at $120/month. To resolve:

- ▶️ Watch the “AI Model Setup” video: [AI Model Setup (API Key)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzMbiamzOqM)
- 🔍 Verify your billing settings in your OpenAI dashboard
- 💳 Add a payment method if one isn’t already on file
- 📊 Check your usage dashboard for any quota or limit warnings

If you’re using a different provider, please refer to their documentation and billing policies for the equivalent steps.

**Why am I getting a token limit error?**

Please refer to your model provider’s documentation for the context window size.

⚠️ If you set a large **max token limit** in your Copilot settings, you may encounter this error.

- **Max tokens** refers to *completion tokens*, not input tokens.
- A higher output token limit means less room for input!

🧠 Behind-the-scenes prompts for Copilot commands also consume tokens, so:

- Keep your message length short
- Set a reasonable max token value to avoid hitting the cap

💡 For QA with unlimited context, switch to the **Vault QA** mode in the dropdown (Copilot v2.1.0+ required).
